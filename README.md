## Dependencies

### Python Packages

- Flask >= 1.0.2
- ctodd-python-lib-logging >= 1.0.0

## Notes

 - Relies on f-string notation, which is limited to Python3.6.  A refactor to remove these could allow for development with Python3.0.x through 3.5.x
 - Meant to be a base, there is some hardcoding that needs to be changed

## TODO

 - Lacking tests and unittest framework
